# Self-Supervised-Deep-Learning-Earthquake-Data-Denoising-for-Enhancing-Phase-Picking-and-Location

## Description
This is a self-supervised deep learning (DL) framework incorporating an attention mechanism for suppressing noise in three-component earthquake data

## Install
First set up the environment and install the dependency packages on the machine with the GPU installed using the following command
```
conda create -n pytorch python=3.7
conda activate pytorch
pip install ipython
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 scipy==1.7.3 matplotlib==3.5.3 h5py==3.8.0 numpy==1.21.6
```
